# You are a part of Aisha's Greetings - a card printing company that prints greetings
# cards with a hint of personalization! You want to help Aisha create a system that
# generates cards based on customer's requests.
#
# You have been provided with two pre-filled card types:
#
# - happy_bday.txt: a card with a birthday message
#
# - thankyou_card.txt: a card file with a thank you message
#
# Click through the files on your right and see what's in them! If you get stuck,
# you can look at a sample solution of the project by looking at greetings_solutions.py
# - but try it out on your own first.
#
# Let's start printing!

#
# Setting Up Custom Greeting Cards
#

# 1. Aisha, the owner of Aisha's Greetings, wants to create a program that will 
#    automatically generate pre-filled orders, using her custom greeting messages.
#    Use your knowledge of context managers to accomplish this goal!
#
#    First, import the contextlib modules @contextmanager decorator, and create
#    a decorated function named generic that takes in card type, sender's name and
#    recipient arguments.
#
# 2. The generic() function will serve the purpose of opening a specific generic 
#    card type (Thank you card or Birthday card) so that it can be used as the 
#    base template for a more customized card.
#
#    Inside the function create the following:
#
#     - A variable to store a call of the open() built-in function that opens up a
#       generic card type based on the card type parameter in read mode. You can
#       assume the store will receive either a birthday card request or a thank
#       you card request.
#
#     - A variable to store a call of the open() built-in function that creates 
#       (and opens) a new card named with the following pattern:
#       < sender_name >_generic.txt
#
#    Use the sender name parameter from the function definition. Open the file in
#    write mode since we will need to write a new card to the file.
#
# 3. Now, you need to make sure the context manager correctly creates a customized
#    card from the generic template. Inside the generi() context manager use the try
#    clause to yield a file so that it creates the following template custom card:
#
#!   Dear < receiver > 
#!   < text from the generic template card >
#!   Sincerely, < sender >
#
#    Make sure to use '\n' to create line breaks!
#
# 4. Finally, make sure to close both files after usage!
#
# 5. It's time for a test run! Aisha's Greetings just got a customer 'Mwenda' who
#    requested an order for a generic Thank You card for her friend 'Amanda'.
#
#    Use a with statement to generate this order. Have the with statement confirm 
#    the card is created by printing 'Card Generated!'.
#
# 6. We want to verify whether or not the correct order was printed in the file. Use a
#    with statement to open and read the file you just created in the last step.

#
# Setting Up Personalized Greeting Cards
#

# 7. Aisha's Greetings also wants to print personalized cards! This means that 
#    customers can tell Aisha's Greetings the words they want in their card and we
#    can print them.
#
#    For personalized cards, let's create a class-based context manager. First, create
#    a class called personalized.
#
# 8. Next, write a __init__ method that takes the sender's and receiver's names and 
#    saves them as attributes. 
#
#    Add one more attribute that stores a newly opened (or created) file in write
#    mode with the format < sender_name >_personalized.txt. This is the file we
#    will be working on!
#
# 9. Now, let's set up what should happen when any new files are created and the 
#    context is started.
#
#    Make an __enter__ method that writes the receiver's name to the opened file and
#    returns that file. The format we write to the file should look like this:
#    Dear < receiver>
#
# 10. Lastly, let's set up the final pieces of the customized card.
#
#     Create an __exit__ method that writes "Sincerely" followed by the sender's 
#     name on the open file and then closes the file!
#
# 11. Time to give our custom card generator a test run!
#
#     Aisha's shop just got a customer 'John' who requested an order for a 
#     personalized card for his close friend 'Michael'.
#
#     John wants the body of the letter to say "I am so proud of you! Being your
#     friend for all these years has been nothing but a blessing. I don't say it often
#     but I just wanted to let you know that you inspire me and I love you! All the best.
#     Always."
#
#     Use the context manager with a with statement to generate this order.

#
# Aisha's Greetings: Picking up speed!
#

# 12. Aisha's Greetings just got two orders from a customer named 'Josiah'.
#
#     He wants to get a generic birthday card for a colleague named 'Remy' and a 
#     personalized card for his sister 'Esther' that says:
#
#     "Happy Birthday!! I love you to the moon and back. Even though you're a pain
#     sometimes, you're a pain I can't live without. I am incredibly proud of you and
#     grateful to have you as a sister. Cheers to 25!! You're getting old!"
#
#     Create a nested with statement that generates these orders in one call.
#
# 13. Congrats! You were able to help Aisha's Greetings create a system that 
#     generates cards quicker and smoother using the knowledge you gained about
#     context managers!
#
#     Take some time to check out the great cards you created!

# Ok got this mostly, used the solution to check something here and there. 
# Still got ways to do, but I think this wraps up the Intermediate Course!
